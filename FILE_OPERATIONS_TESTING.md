## How to Test File Operations

### 1. Quick Test (Automated)
```bash
# Run the automated test script
python test_file_operations.py
```

### 2. Manual Testing via Discord UI

To test the full upload/download cycle, you can:

**Option A: Test with Discord Agent**
1. Start a Discord agent: `python multi_agent_launcher.py --agents grok4_agent`
2. In Discord, ask the bot: "Can you create and upload a simple text file for me?"
3. The bot should generate a file and upload it using the new tools

**Option B: Upload a file and test download**
1. Upload any file to Discord via the UI
2. Ask the bot: "Can you download that file I just uploaded?"  
3. The bot should use `get_message_attachments` and `download_attachment`

### 3. Developer Test Script Usage

```python
# test_file_operations.py demonstrates:

# 1. List available file operation tools
tools_result = await session.list_tools()
# Confirms: send_file, send_file_from_bytes, get_message_attachments, download_attachment

# 2. Upload a test file
upload_result = await session.call_tool("send_file", {
    "channel_id": "1395578179531309089",
    "file_path": "/Users/greg/repos/SuperAgent/test_upload.txt", 
    "content": "ü§ñ Test message with file attachment"
})

# Returns: "File uploaded successfully. Message ID: 1396988204409950318"
```

## Integration with Enhanced Discord Agent

The file operations are now available to the `enhanced_discord_agent.py`. To use them:

### Example: Bot Generates and Uploads a Report
```python
# In enhanced_discord_agent.py
async def generate_and_upload_report(self, session: ClientSession, channel_id: str, data: dict):
    """Generate a report and upload it to Discord"""
    
    # 1. Generate report content  
    report_content = f"""
    SuperAgent Analysis Report
    Generated: {datetime.now()}
    
    Data Summary:
    {json.dumps(data, indent=2)}
    """
    
    # 2. Save to temporary file
    temp_path = f"temp/report_{int(time.time())}.txt"
    os.makedirs("temp", exist_ok=True)
    with open(temp_path, "w") as f:
        f.write(report_content)
    
    # 3. Upload via MCP Discord tool
    result = await session.call_tool("send_file", {
        "channel_id": channel_id,
        "file_path": temp_path,
        "content": "üìä Here's your analysis report!"
    })
    
    # 4. Clean up
    os.remove(temp_path)
    return result
```

### Example: Bot Downloads and Processes Uploaded File
```python
async def process_uploaded_file(self, session: ClientSession, message_data: dict):
    """Download and process a file uploaded by user"""
    
    # 1. Get attachments from the message
    attachments_result = await session.call_tool("get_message_attachments", {
        "channel_id": message_data["channel_id"],
        "message_id": message_data["id"]
    })
    
    # 2. Download first attachment
    if "Found 1 attachments" in attachments_result.content[0].text:
        # Parse filename from response (or extract from message_data)
        filename = "user_upload.txt"  # Would parse this from response
        
        download_result = await session.call_tool("download_attachment", {
            "channel_id": message_data["channel_id"], 
            "message_id": message_data["id"],
            "attachment_filename": filename
        })
        
        # 3. Process the downloaded file
        if "downloaded successfully" in download_result.content[0].text:
            with open(f"downloads/{filename}", "r") as f:
                content = f.read()
                # Process content with LLM...
                return await self.analyze_file_content(content)
```

## File Operation Details

### `send_file` Tool
- **Purpose**: Upload files from local filesystem
- **Parameters**: `channel_id`, `file_path`, `filename` (optional), `content` (optional)
- **Returns**: Message ID and filename confirmation
- **File Size Limit**: Discord default (10MB for non-Nitro users)

### `send_file_from_bytes` Tool  
- **Purpose**: Upload generated content as files
- **Parameters**: `channel_id`, `file_data` (base64), `filename`, `content` (optional)
- **Use Cases**: Generated reports, analysis results, code files
- **Example**: Converting text/JSON to downloadable files

### `get_message_attachments` Tool
- **Purpose**: List attachments from specific messages
- **Parameters**: `channel_id`, `message_id` 
- **Returns**: Array of attachment info (filename, URL, size, content_type)
- **Use Case**: Before downloading, check what's available

### `download_attachment` Tool
- **Purpose**: Download attachments to local storage
- **Parameters**: `channel_id`, `message_id`, `attachment_filename`, `save_path` (optional)
- **Default Location**: `downloads/` directory (auto-created)
- **File Types**: All Discord-supported file types
- **Security**: Uses `use_cached=False` for non-image files

## Next Steps for Enhancement

### Phase 2 Features (Not Yet Implemented)
1. **Batch Operations**: Upload/download multiple files at once
2. **File Type Validation**: Check extensions and MIME types
3. **File Processing**: PDF parsing, image analysis, CSV processing
4. **Compression**: Auto-zip large file collections
5. **File Management**: List/delete old downloads, storage limits

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Code Execution**: Download code files, execute, upload results
2. **Data Analysis**: Process uploaded CSVs, generate visualized reports  
3. **Document Generation**: Create PDFs, Word docs, presentations
4. **Version Control**: Git integration for code file management
5. **Backup/Archive**: Automatic conversation/file archiving

## Security Considerations

‚úÖ **Implemented**:
- File existence validation before upload
- Directory creation with proper permissions  
- Error handling for invalid files/permissions
- `use_cached=False` for secure attachment downloads

üöß **Recommended Additions**:
- File size limits and validation
- Extension allowlist/blocklist  
- Virus scanning for downloads
- User permission checks
- Rate limiting for file operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"File not found" errors**:
- Verify file path exists and is accessible
- Check file permissions for read access
- Use absolute paths when possible

**"Attachment not found" errors**:
- Confirm message ID is correct and recent
- Check attachment filename spelling (case-sensitive)
- Verify bot has permission to read message history

**"Connection closed" errors**:
- Ensure Discord bot token is valid and active
- Check DEFAULT_SERVER_ID is correct
- Verify bot has necessary Discord permissions

**Import/dependency errors**:
- Run MCP Discord server with proper `uv` command structure
- Ensure all dependencies in mcp-discord-global are installed
- Check Python path and virtual environment

## MCP Discord Server Changes

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/greg/mcp-discord-global/src/discord_mcp/server.py`
  - Added 4 new tool definitions (lines 639-734)
  - Added 4 new tool implementations (lines 1686-1799) 
  - Total tools increased from 25 to 29

# SuperAgent Control Plane Implementation Roadmap

## Quick Start Path

### Week 1: MVP DevOps Agent
**Goal**: Get basic visibility and control working

1. **Day 1-2: Basic DevOps Agent**
   - [ ] Set up `devops_agent.py` with Docker management
   - [ ] Implement spawn/stop/logs commands
   - [ ] Basic agent registry in memory
   - [ ] Test with existing containers

2. **Day 3-4: Discord Integration**
   - [ ] Add Discord bot to DevOps agent
   - [ ] Implement !status, !deploy, !stop commands
   - [ ] Test in Discord server
   - [ ] Add basic error handling

3. **Day 5-7: Configuration & Persistence**
   - [ ] Load agent configs from JSON files
   - [ ] Save agent state to disk
   - [ ] Add config validation
   - [ ] Implement health checks

### Week 2: Enhanced Functionality
**Goal**: Production-ready DevOps agent

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - [ ] System resource tracking
   - [ ] Container health monitoring
   - [ ] Auto-recovery for failed agents
   - [ ] Alerting in Discord

2. **Team Management**
   - [ ] Create team configurations
   - [ ] Assign agents to teams
   - [ ] Track team activities
   - [ ] Basic task assignment

3. **Advanced Container Ops**
   - [ ] Container resource limits
   - [ ] Volume management
   - [ ] Network isolation
   - [ ] Log aggregation

### Week 3: Web Dashboard
**Goal**: Visual control interface

1. **Backend API**
   - [ ] FastAPI server
   - [ ] WebSocket for real-time updates
   - [ ] RESTful endpoints
   - [ ] Authentication

2. **Frontend Dashboard**
   - [ ] Agent status grid
   - [ ] Team management UI
   - [ ] Log viewer
   - [ ] Deploy/stop controls

3. **Integration**
   - [ ] Connect to DevOps agent
   - [ ] Real-time updates
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Mobile responsive

### Week 4: Polish & Testing
**Goal**: Production deployment

1. **Testing**
   - [ ] Unit tests for DevOps agent
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] Load testing
   - [ ] Chaos testing

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] User guide
   - [ ] API documentation
   - [ ] Deployment guide
   - [ ] Troubleshooting

3. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Systemd service for DevOps agent
   - [ ] Docker compose setup
   - [ ] Backup procedures
   - [ ] Monitoring setup

## Immediate Next Steps (Today)

1. **Create DevOps Agent Discord Bot**
   ```python
   # Start with simple bot that can:
   - Connect to Discord
   - List Docker containers  
   - Show agent status
   - Basic spawn/stop commands
   ```

2. **Test with Existing Setup**
   - Use existing mcp-discord containers
   - Verify Docker management works
   - Test Discord commands
   - Check resource usage

3. **Create Agent Config Templates**
   ```json
   {
     "agents": {
       "grok4": {...},
       "claude": {...},
       "manager": {...}
     }
   }
   ```

## File Creation Order

1. `control_plane/__init__.py`
2. `control_plane/devops_agent.py` (simplified from spec)
3. `configs/devops_config.json`
4. `configs/agents/grok4_template.json`
5. `test_devops_agent.py`

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (DevOps Agent)
- ✅ Can spawn/stop containers via Discord
- ✅ Shows real-time agent status
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Persists state across restarts

### Phase 2 (Dashboard)
- ✅ Web UI shows all agents
- ✅ Can deploy agents from UI
- ✅ Real-time updates work
- ✅ Mobile friendly

### Phase 3 (Production)
- ✅ 99% uptime
- ✅ Auto-recovery works
- ✅ Scales to 20+ agents
- ✅ Full audit trail

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Docker Permission Issues**
   - Run DevOps agent with proper groups
   - Test socket access early
   - Have fallback connection methods

2. **Discord Rate Limits**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Batch status updates
   - Use webhooks for high volume

3. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Set container limits
   - Monitor system resources
   - Auto-stop idle agents

4. **Security**
   - Encrypt Discord tokens
   - Limit DevOps agent permissions
   - Audit all actions
   - Secure API endpoints

## Alternative Approaches

If full implementation is too complex:

1. **Simple CLI Tool**
   - Python script with commands
   - No Discord integration
   - Basic container management

2. **Discord-Only Interface**
   - Skip web dashboard
   - All control via Discord
   - Simpler architecture

3. **Static Dashboard**
   - HTML file with JS
   - Polls JSON status file
   - No backend needed

## Conclusion

Start with the DevOps Agent core functionality. Get Discord commands working first for immediate visibility and control. The web dashboard can come later once the foundation is solid.

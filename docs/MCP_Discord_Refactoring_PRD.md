# Product Requirements Document: MCP Discord Server Refactoring

## 1. Executive Summary

### Objective
Refactor the existing mcp-discord implementation to create a robust, production-ready Discord integration that follows MCP best practices, supports containerized deployments, and enables reliable multi-agent communication.

### Current State
- Basic STDIO implementation with manual tool handling
- Works in containers with Python workarounds (`__main__.py` hack)
- Single-threaded, potential asyncio conflicts
- No proper error handling or reconnection logic

### Target State
- Modern FastMCP implementation with automatic tool handling
- Native HTTP/SSE transport support for containerized environments
- Proper async handling and Discord bot lifecycle management
- Enterprise-grade reliability with error recovery

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Architecture Improvements

#### Use FastMCP Framework
- **Current**: Low-level `Server` class with manual `@app.list_tools()` and `@app.call_tool()`
- **Target**: High-level `FastMCP` with `@mcp.tool()` decorators
- **Benefits**: 
  - Automatic schema generation
  - Built-in validation
  - Cleaner code structure
  - Better error handling

#### Support Multiple Transports
- **STDIO**: For local development and single-user scenarios
- **HTTP/SSE**: For containerized deployments and multi-client access
- **WebSocket** (future): For real-time bidirectional communication

#### Proper Async Architecture
- Isolate Discord bot event loop from MCP server loop
- Use `asyncio.create_task()` properly without blocking
- Implement graceful shutdown handlers
- Add connection state management

### 2.2 Robustness Requirements

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try/catch blocks for all Discord API calls
- Proper MCP error responses (not raw exceptions)
- Rate limit handling with exponential backoff
- Network error recovery

#### Logging & Monitoring
- Structured logging to stderr only (never stdout)
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
- Performance metrics (response times, API calls)
- Health check endpoint for container orchestration

#### Connection Management
- Auto-reconnect on Discord disconnection
- Connection pooling for multiple bot instances
- Graceful degradation when Discord is unavailable
- Status reporting through MCP

### 2.3 Container-First Design

#### Configuration
- Environment variable support for all settings
- Config file fallback with JSON/YAML
- Runtime config validation
- Secret management best practices

#### Deployment
- Multi-stage Dockerfile with minimal runtime
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Resource limits and requests
- Horizontal scaling support

#### Dependencies
- Pin all dependency versions
- Use lightweight base images
- Include both pip and uv support
- Automated dependency updates

## 3. Feature Requirements

### 3.1 Core Discord Operations

#### Enhanced Tools
- **send_message**: With attachments, embeds, reactions
- **read_messages**: With filtering, search, pagination
- **manage_channels**: Create, update, delete with permissions
- **user_management**: Roles, kicks, bans with audit logs
- **server_info**: Detailed server/channel/member data

#### New Capabilities
- **Bulk operations**: Send to multiple channels
- **Message scheduling**: Delayed message sending
- **Event subscriptions**: Real-time message monitoring
- **Webhook support**: For external integrations
- **Voice channel info**: Basic voice state data

### 3.2 Multi-Agent Support

#### Agent Identity
- Per-agent Discord tokens (not shared)
- Agent name/avatar customization
- Role-based permissions per agent
- Activity status management

#### Coordination Features
- Cross-agent message passing
- Shared context/memory access
- Agent presence detection
- Workload distribution

### 3.3 Security & Compliance

#### Authentication
- Secure token storage (never in code)
- OAuth2 support for user auth
- API key rotation support
- Audit logging for all actions

#### Permissions
- Granular tool permissions
- Channel-specific access control
- Rate limiting per agent
- Abuse prevention

## 4. Implementation Approach

### 4.1 Phased Rollout

**Phase 1: Core Refactoring**
- Migrate to FastMCP
- Implement HTTP transport
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Create test suite

**Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
- Add new Discord tools
- Implement bulk operations
- Add monitoring/metrics
- Performance optimization

**Phase 3: Production Hardening**
- Security audit
- Load testing
- Documentation
- Migration tools

### 4.2 Backward Compatibility

- Maintain STDIO interface during transition
- Tool naming compatibility layer
- Config migration utilities
- Deprecation warnings

### 4.3 Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all tools
- Integration tests with Discord
- Container deployment tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Chaos engineering tests

## 5. Success Metrics

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime for MCP server
- <100ms response time for tool calls
- Zero data loss on disconnections
- Automatic recovery from all transient errors

### Scalability
- Support 100+ concurrent agents
- Handle 1000+ messages/second
- Linear scaling with container count
- Minimal resource usage per agent

### Developer Experience
- Single command deployment
- Clear error messages
- Comprehensive documentation
- Example implementations

## 6. Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Discord API changes**: Abstract API layer, version pinning
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Profiling, caching, connection pooling
- **Asyncio complexity**: Careful design, extensive testing

### Operational Risks
- **Migration complexity**: Phased approach, rollback plan
- **Container orchestration**: K8s templates, docker-compose examples
- **Multi-region latency**: Regional deployments, edge caching

## 7. Future Enhancements

- GraphQL API for complex queries
- Redis integration for distributed state
- Prometheus metrics export
- Kubernetes operator
- CLI management tools
- Web dashboard
- Machine learning integrations
- Voice channel support

## 8. Conclusion

This refactoring will transform the mcp-discord server from a prototype into a production-ready system capable of supporting the entire SuperAgent ecosystem. The investment in proper architecture and robustness will pay dividends as the system scales.
